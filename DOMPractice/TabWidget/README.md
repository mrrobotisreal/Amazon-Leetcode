## Description
This is a very simple project I completed, just to showcase my vanilla JavaScript(TypeScript in this case) skills about ability to manipulate the DOM. I created a tab widget that accepts a name for a tab in the input at the top, which upon clicking the Add Tab button uses the fetch API to get a random dog image, which is then displayed in a tab body below with a tab header button. Each new tab adds a button horizontally above the tab body and the newly added tab will be chosen and display it's image automatically, and the color of the text inside the tab header button denotes that it is currently displaying it's image with green text, and all other tab header button's text will be white. Only one image is displayed at a time for the specific tab that has been chosen.
